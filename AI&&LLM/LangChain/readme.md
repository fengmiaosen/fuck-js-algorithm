LangChain is the open, composable framework that provides a standard interface for every model, tool, and database â€“ so you can build LLM apps that adapt as fast as the ecosystem evolves.

## Concepts

- **Chat models**  
  LLMs exposed via a chat API that process sequences of messages as input and output a message.

- **Messages**  
  The unit of communication in chat models, used to represent model input and output.

- **Chat history**  
  A conversation represented as a sequence of messages, alternating between user messages and model responses.

- **Tools**  
  A function with an associated schema defining the function's name, description, and the arguments it accepts.

- **Tool calling**  
  A type of chat model API that accepts tool schemas, along with messages, as input and returns invocations of those tools as part of the output message.

- **Structured output**  
  A technique to make a chat model respond in a structured format, such as JSON that matches a given schema.

- **Memory**  
  Information about a conversation that is persisted so that it can be used in future conversations.

- **Multimodality**  
  The ability to work with data that comes in different forms, such as text, audio, images, and video.

- **Runnable interface**  
  The base abstraction that many LangChain components and the LangChain Expression Language are built on.

- **Streaming**  
  LangChain streaming APIs for surfacing results as they are generated.

- **LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)**  
  A syntax for orchestrating LangChain components. Most useful for simpler applications.

- **Document loaders**  
  Load a source as a list of documents.

- **Retrieval**  
  Information retrieval systems can retrieve structured or unstructured data from a datasource in response to a query.

- **Text splitters**  
  Split long text into smaller chunks that can be individually indexed to enable granular retrieval.

- **Embedding models**  
  Models that represent data such as text or images in a vector space.

- **Vector stores**  
  Storage of and efficient search over vectors and associated metadata.

- **Retriever**  
  A component that returns relevant documents from a knowledge base in response to a query.

- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
  A technique that enhances language models by combining them with external knowledge bases.

- **Agents**  
  Use a language model to choose a sequence of actions to take. Agents can interact with external resources via tool.

- **Prompt templates**  
  Component for factoring out the static parts of a model "prompt" (usually a sequence of messages). Useful for serializing, versioning, and reusing these static parts.

- **Output parsers**  
  Responsible for taking the output of a model and transforming it into a more suitable format for downstream tasks. Output parsers were primarily useful prior to the general availability of tool calling and structured outputs.

- **Few-shot prompting**  
  A technique for improving model performance by providing a few examples of the task to perform in the prompt.

- **Example selectors**  
  Used to select the most relevant examples from a dataset based on a given input. Example selectors are used in few-shot prompting to select examples for a prompt.

- **Async programming**  
  The basics that one should know to use LangChain in an asynchronous context.

- **Callbacks**  
  Callbacks enable the execution of custom auxiliary code in built-in components. Callbacks are used to stream outputs from LLMs in LangChain, trace the intermediate steps of an application, and more.

- **Tracing**  
  The process of recording the steps that an application takes to go from input to output. Tracing is essential for debugging and diagnosing issues in complex applications.

- **Evaluation**  
  The process of assessing the performance and effectiveness of AI applications. This involves testing the model's responses against a set of predefined criteria or benchmarks to ensure it meets the desired quality standards and fulfills the intended purpose. This process is vital for building reliable applications.

- **Testing**  
  The process of verifying that a component of an integration or application works as expected. Testing is essential for ensuring that the application behaves correctly and that changes to the codebase do not introduce new bugs.
