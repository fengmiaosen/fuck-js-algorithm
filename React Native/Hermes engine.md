## Hermes engine

**Hermes** is an open-source JavaScript engine optimized for React Native. For many apps, using Hermes will result in improved start-up time, decreased memory usage, and smaller app size when compared to **JavaScriptCore**. 

**Hermes** is used by default by React Native and no additional configuration is required to enable it.
