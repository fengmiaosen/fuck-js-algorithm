## 猎头同步的可能会聊的话题

### 问题 1 如何看待办公地点设置在上海 还是 杭州？

1. 我认为杭州或者上海都有其各自的优势和不足
* 上海的优劣势
    * 对外国人来说有非常高的国际知名度，良好的外资企业环境，丰富的工程师人才资源，包括英语熟练的人才资源比较丰富，所以外企数量也比较多
    * 工作生活成本相对比较高，企业运行成本比较高
* 杭州的优劣势
    * 良好的城市自然环境，比如西湖西溪湿地，并不像上海那么多人，适合工作生活
    * 高效的政府运行效率，良好的企业运营环境氛围，
    * 丰富的软件工程师资源，比如有阿里巴巴的总部、快手电商和抖音电商的研发中心，尤其是电商和广告方面的工程师人才资源比较丰富
    * 工作生活成本相对比较低，相比上海
1. 无论未来选择哪个城市，我都完全没问题，毕竟二者距离并不远，高铁一小时即可抵达

Question 1 How do you think the office is set up in Shanghai or Hangzhou?

I think Hangzhou or Shanghai have their own advantages and weaknesses.

Advantages and disadvantages of Shanghai

For foreigners, it has a very high international reputation, a good foreign-funded enterprise environment, rich engineer talent resources, including talents proficient in English, so the number of foreign enterprises is also relatively large.

The cost of work and living is relatively high, and the operating cost of the enterprise is relatively high.

The advantages and disadvantages of Hangzhou

The good urban natural environment, such as the West Lake Xixi Wetland, is not as many as there in Shanghai, which is suitable for work and life.

Efficient government operation efficiency, good enterprise operation environment atmosphere,

Rich software engineer resources, such as the headquarters of Alibaba, the research and development center of Kuaishou e-commerce and TikTok e-commerce, especially the resources of engineers in e-commerce and advertising are relatively rich.

The cost of work and life is relatively low, compared with shanghai

No matter which city I choose in the future, I have no problem at all. After all, the two are not far away, and the high-speed rail can be reached in an hour.

### 问题2：现在的薪资水平多少？期望值多少

1. 现在现金部分总共 80w人民币，还有部分股票，大概10W
2. 期望可以在现在基础上有一定涨幅，但具体数字可以商量，并不设置具体的限制

Question 2: What is the current salary level? What is the expected value?

Now the cash part is 80w RMB in total, and some stock is about 10W.

It is expected that there can be a certain increase on the current basis, but the specific figures can be negotiated, and no specific restrictions will be set.

### 问题 3： 平时有什么兴趣爱好？

爬山
自驾游
	最近 2 年多的时间里，我已经自驾了中国三分之一的省市，总里程 5w 公里。
	今年 7 月份，带着家人从杭州出发最远自驾去了新疆，全程往返 13000 公里。
摄影录像
	（我有尼康单反相机、大疆运动相机 action5 pro）

Question 3: What are your usual hobbies?

Mountain climbing, 
self-driving tour,
	In the past two years, I have driven to one-third of China's provinces and cities, with a total mileage of 5w kilometers.
	In July this year, I took my family from Hangzhou to Xinjiang by driving the farthest, with a round trip of 13,000 kilometers.
