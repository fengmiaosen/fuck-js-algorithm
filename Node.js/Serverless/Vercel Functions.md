Vercel Functions lets you run server-side code without managing servers. They adapt automatically to user demand, handle connections to APIs and databases, and offer enhanced concurrency through fluid compute, which is useful for AI workloads or any I/O-bound
 tasks that require efficient scaling

When you deploy your application, Vercel automatically sets up the tools and optimizations for your chosen framework. It ensures low latency by routing traffic through Vercel's CDN, and placing your functions in a specific region when you need more control over data locality.
